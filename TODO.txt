[ ] Not Started
[x] Done
[~] In Progress
[!] Won't Do

Milestone: v0.4.0
-----------------

[~] /_telodendria/admin/config endpoint
    [ ] Update only certain values

[~] Client-Server API
    [x] 6: Filtering
        [x] Finish validating filters before saving them.
    [~] 7: Events
        [x] Compute size of JSON object in Canonical JSON
        [x] Rename Sha2.h to just Sha; add Sha1() function
        [x] Make Sha256() return raw bytes; add function to
            convert to hex string.
    [~] 8: Rooms
    [~] 9: User Data
        [x] Profiles
        [~] Directory

[ ] Admin API
    [ ] Registration token endpoints

[~] Cytoplasm
    [~] Debug OpenSSL
        [x] Database corruption
        [ ] File descriptor exhaustion
    [ ] Fix tp on NetBSD
[ ] Random memory corruption after many requests.
[ ] HOST_NAME_MAX not defined on some systems?
    -  Check if POSIX
    - Might be enough to #define it when it doesn't exist.
[~] j2s
    [x] Properly support arrays of primitives.
    [ ] How to set default value of true on boolean?
        - defaults probably need to be set at parser level, not
          enough to set it after.
        - Or booleans should default to -1 if not specified, let the
          higher level logic set the default from there.
    [ ] Write man page.

[x] Refactor MatrixErrorCreate() to take a custom message or NULL to
    use the default. This will make debugging a lot easier.
    [ ] Use detailed error messages for HTTP 500s at the minimum. Other
        error messages might also be useful.
[x] Make sure admin registration token is printed to log, not stdout.
    Unless they are the same, of course.
[ ] Refactor Config to use j2s.
[ ] Refactor other endpoints to use j2s for validating request bodies.

[ ] Add parser API to parse the identifier grammers
    [ ] Use in alias endpoints
[ ] Finish RouteRoomAliases
    [ ] Get from "id" in aliases
    [ ] Note to check permissions according to spec
[ ] Finish RouteAliasDirectory
    [ ] Add "id" objects when putting aliases
