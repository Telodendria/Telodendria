    [ ] Update only certain values

[~] Client-Server API
    [x] 6: Filtering
        [x] Finish validating filters before saving them.
    [~] 7: Events

[ ] Admin API
    [ ] Registration token endpoints

[~] Cytoplasm
    [~] Debug OpenSSL
        [x] Database corruption
        [ ] File descriptor exhaustion
[ ] Random memory corruption after many requests.
[~] j2s
    [x] Properly support arrays of primitives.
    [ ] How to set default value of true on boolean?
        - defaults probably need to be set at parser level, not
          enough to set it after.
        - Or booleans should default to -1 if not specified, let the
          higher level logic set the default from there.
    [ ] Write man page.

[ ] Refactor MatrixErrorCreate() to take a custom message or NULL to
    use the default. This will make debugging a lot easier.
[x] Make sure admin registration token is printed to log, not stdout.
    Unless they are the same, of course.
[ ] Refactor Config to use j2s.
[ ] Refactor other endpoints to use j2s for validating request bodies.
