Milestone: v0.2.0
Due: July 1, 2023
-----------------

[ ] Clean up memory API
	[ ] Use double hashing instead of linear probing
	[!] Store block info inside the block, not as a separate block
		- This makes it too easy to clobber the memory information. By
		  making it a separate block, there's less of a chance of the
		  information getting destroyed. It's worth a few extra bytes of
		  memory to make accidents harder, I think.
