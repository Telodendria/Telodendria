# [Telodendria](https://telodendria.io)

**Telodendria** is an open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional.

**Important:** This project is not developed on GitHub, or even with Git. As such, GitHub Pull Requests are not accepted. But that doesn't mean we don't want your contribution! You're more than welcome to clone this repo and use Git to make changes to the project if you'd prefer it to CVS, but when it comes time to actually submit your changes to this project, use [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) to generate patch files, then submit them to the official Matrix room: [#telodendria-patches:bancino.net](https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-patches:bancino.net).

Please see the `README.txt` file for the actual project `README`, which simply details the repository structure a little bit. All of **Telodendria**'s user and developer documentation is available as `man` pages, or online.
