# [Telodendria](https://telodendria.io)

**Telodendria** is an open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional.

**Important:** This project is not developed on GitHub or CVS anymore, but instead on a dedicated [Gitea forge](https://git.telodendria.io/Telodendria/telodendria).

Please see the `README.txt` file for the actual project `README`, which simply details the repository structure a little bit. All of **Telodendria**'s user and developer documentation is available as `man` pages, or online.
