.Dt TELODENDRIA-CHANGELOG 7
.Os Telodendria Project
.Sh NAME
.Nm Telodendria
.Nd The change log for the Telodendria project.
.Sh PROJECT STATUS
.Pp
.Nm
is a very ambitious project. There's a lot that needs to happen yet
before it is usable. At the moment,
.Nm
is starting to resemble a Matrix homeserver, but you can't really
call it one yet. The foundation is mostly in place; now there's the
Matrix specification to implement.
.Pp
Just because there's not much here yet doesn't mean you should go
away! I could always use help, so you are more than welcome to get
involved in the project if you want to see things move quicker.
Feel free to donate using the links on the project website, or
see the
.Xr contributing 7
page for details on how to get involved. The CVS repository has
a file called
.Pa TODO.txt ,
which contains a checklist of the items that need to be completed.
Feel free to grab an item on that list and start writing patches!
It's a good idea to join the Matrix rooms noted in
.Xr telodendria 7
as well, so you can discuss your progress and ask questions.
.Sh v0.1.1
.Pp
Not released yet.

Changes:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Improved HTTP request logging by removing unnecessary
log entries and making errors more specific.
.It
Added a way to safely delete objects from the database.
While the database is for persistent storage, there may
be some ephemeral data that lives there only for a short
while, so it will be necessary to remove that data when
necessary.
.El
.Pp
Bug fixes:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fixed a memory leak that would occur when parsing an invalid
JSON object.
.It
Fixed an edge case where HTTP response headers were being
sent before they were properly set, causing the server to
report a status of 200 even when that wasn't the desired
status.
.It
Fixed a few memory leaks in the HTTP parameter decoder that
would occur in some edge cases.
.It
Fixed an "off-by-one" error in the HTTP server request
parser that prevented GET parameters from being parsed.
.El
.Pp
Misc.:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fixed a bug in
.Xr td 8
that caused
.Xr cvs 1
to be invoked in the wrong directory when tagging a new release.
.It
Added support for environment variable substitution in all site
files. This makes it easier to release
.Nm
versions.
.It
Fix whitespace issues in various shell scripts.
.El
.Sh v0.1.0
.Pp
Tuesday, December 13, 2022
.Pp
This is the first public release of
.Nm
so there are no changes to report. Future releases will
have a complete change log entry here.
.Pp
This is a symbolic release targeted at developers, so there's nothing
useful to ordinary users yet. Stay tuned for future releases though!
